# Rust Training - Manual implementations of data structures and classic algorithms

This is a training repository with samples about data structures and classic algorithms.

I'll do organize folders with samples and explanations about each work.

This is a new idea for me and I'll soon organize. If do you have idea for contribute, great. Feel free.

My goal don't is make the "Oh My God, the awesome work". Is only practice `Rust` language and have fun.
